            <p class="summary">You control a handful of aliens on a small planet. <strong>Your goal is to turn them into a populous, technologically advanced civilization.</strong></p>
            <p>You must gather resources and expand your scientific knowledge. You can build mines and factories, assign workers to them, watch your storages fill, and spend those resources on upgrading or building more buildings.</p>

                <p>The planet’s surface is made of rock, with high mineral density and quality. It's also is covered with <strong>craters</strong>, <strong>cracks</strong>, <strong>lakes</strong>, and <strong>flowers</strong>.<p>
                <p>The <strong>craters</strong> were formed by asteroid impacts a long time ago. They broke the planet’s cortex and let out fumes from <strong>underground gas reservoirs</strong>. Those fumes form clouds, and they turned out to be <strong>nutritious</strong>!</p>
                <p>The <strong>cracks</strong> on the planet reveal its mantle: bright and molten. It provides light and heat to its inhabitants, who must watch their step! Since the planet is so <strong>small</strong>, it would theoretically be possible to draw liquid metals from the mantle by lowering a bucket on a rope through one of those cracks.</p>
                <img class="float-right" src="planetlayers.png"/>
                <p>A couple of <strong>lakes</strong> of <strong>mysterious dark liquid</strong> (not safe for drinking or even swimming) decorate the planet too.</p>
                <p>The most interesting feature on the planet is the <strong>[big flower]</strong>. The planet's nucleous is in fact a seed, from which a special flower grows. The high pressure in the planet's nucleous has turned parts of this flower into <strong>diamond</strong>, which protect it from the high temperatures in the mantle on its way to the surface.</p>
                <p>The flower's roots extend through the entire planet's underground, and smaller flowers grow all over the surface.</p>

                <p>This is an <strong>incremental city building game set on a small planet</strong> for mobile, developed with the <a href="https://unity.com" target="_blank">Unity engine</a>.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>This is the most current mock-up of what the game's main screen will look like:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>At the top there is all the information about the resources: amount and production/consumption rate.<br/>
                            On tap, an info box pops up with more detailed information.
                        </li>
                        <li>At the center you can see the planet in all its glory. All its farms, mines and factories working, and its citizens walking around.<br/>
                            You can drag your finger on the screen to turn the camera around the planet, and tap on buildings and people to see more information about them (pictures below).
                        </li>
                        <li>At the bottom there is the main menu. It lets you access the buildings list, science tree, the people list, the story fragments, the achievements, and the in-game store.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

            <div class="image-right-text-left">

                <div>
                    <p>This is the latest screenshot from the game: 12/11/2019.</p>
                    <p>Right now the story is written, and the basic functionality is implemented:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Building buildings.</li>
                        <li>Assigning people to buildings.</li>
                        <li>Resource production.</li>
                        <li>Science tree.</li>
                        <li>Dialogue system.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I'm currently working on the UI: adding new buttons for all the extra features, and designing a clear and intuitive navigation system.</p>
                    <p>The next step will be to add content: create and balance the buildings, and write the dialogues.</p>
                    <p>The game is being implemented in a way that will allow for streamlined localization to several languages.</p>
                </div>
                <img src="latestscreenshot.png"/>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>The following screenshots show the building info panel at the bottom of the screen, which appears when you tap a building:</p>
                <img class="hide-on-mobile" src="differentviews-all.png"/>
                <img class="hide-on-desktop" src="differentviews-1.png"/>
                <p>The building info panel shows the building's name and level, an image of it (currently blank), the list of workers assigned to it, and:
                <ul>
                    <li>If the building is under construction, it shows the time until the construction finishes.</li>
                    <li>If not, it shows the production and consumption rate of resources and energy, and the "upgrade button" with its upgrade cost.</li>
                </ul></p>
                <img class="hide-on-desktop" src="differentviews-2.png"/>
                <p>If you tap one of the employees or an empty slot, the characters list pops up and you can choose one of them and assign it to that slot. If the slot was occupied, the previous worker will be released.</p>
